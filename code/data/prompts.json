I've always wanted to fix my issues, but I never get around to it.\n   How can I change my feeling of being worthless to everyone?",

  "I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.

Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?",
